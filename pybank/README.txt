The purpose of this Python script is for analyzing the financial records of a rhetorical company.  A set of data was provided that consisted of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. The script was designed to analyze the records to calculate the following:

1.  The total number of months included in the dataset
2.  The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3.  Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
4.  The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5.  The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The output of this is included in the same respository in the Analysis folder.
